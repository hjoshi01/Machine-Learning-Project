Predicting outcomes of International Football Matches with Machine Learning Algorithms

Soccer is a popular sport enjoyed by millions of people around the world. Predicting the outcome of soccer matches is of interest to both fans and professionals in the field. The objective of this project is to develop a model that can predict the winner of international soccer matches based on historical match data. The models are built using feature engineering and deep learning. Our models can help inform decisions related to sports betting, team selection, and tournament preparation.

Problem statement:

The problem we are attempting to solve is predicting the winner of a FIFA World Cup match based on the historical data of the teams involved. The dataset includes information about the teams, including their rankings, scores, and other metrics. 

Data
The dataset we used in this project can be found on Kaggle and the link is attached below. This dataset has 3280 rows and 25 columns. Some of the important columns which are useful in determining winner are: 

date: Date of the match
home_team: Name of the home team
away_team: Name of the away team
tournament: Name of the tournament
city: Name of the city where the match was played.
country: Name of the country where the match was played.
neutral_location: Boolean indicating if the match was played at a neutral location.
home_team_mean_offense_score: Mean offense score of the home team
home_team_mean_midfield_score: Mean midfield score of the home team
away_team_mean_defense_score: Mean defence score of the away team
away_team_mean_offense_score: Mean offense score of the away team
away_team_mean_midfield_score: Mean midfield score of the away team
